# IEOR 142A Spring 2025 ‚Äì Egg Price Prediction Project

## üìå What This Project Is

This project was developed as part of the final assignment for **IEOR 142A: Machine Learning and Data Analytics** at UC Berkeley. The goal was to explore real-world data through the lens of machine learning by selecting a topic of interest and applying models learned in the course.

In this case, the team focused on **estimating egg prices** using a variety of machine learning models and time series forecasting techniques. The project not only predicts future prices but also analyzes which features are most correlated with fluctuations in egg pricing.

## üí° Why This Project Matters

Egg pricing is influenced by a complex set of factors including supply chain disruptions, feed costs, consumer demand, outbreaks, and economic indicators. Understanding and forecasting egg prices has real implications for both consumers and agricultural suppliers.

This project is useful as:

* A case study in applying machine learning models from scratch.
* A practical example of time series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA.
* A demonstration of combining both traditional statistical methods and ensemble learning (e.g., Random Forest).
* A framework for analyzing feature importance in price prediction problems.

## üöÄ How to Explore or Reuse the Project

1. Clone the repository and navigate through the notebook and script files to view model implementations.
2. Review the data exploration and preprocessing steps for insights into handling real-world agricultural data.
3. Open the final report (`report.pdf`) to see the full methodology, results, and visualizations.
4. For time series forecasting implementation, check the sections on **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **backtesting**.
5. For machine learning models, explore the use of **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression**, including how feature importances were extracted and interpreted.

## üë• Who Created and Contributed to This Project

This project was created by a team of students in the Spring 2025 offering of **IEOR 142A** at UC Berkeley. The team implemented all models from scratch and carried out all analysis, modeling, and presentation deliverables.

The course is taught by faculty in the **Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)** department, with guidance and feedback provided by the course staff.
